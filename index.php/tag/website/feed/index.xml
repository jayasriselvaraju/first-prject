										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The goal of this new editor is to make adding rich content to WordPress simple and enjoyable. This whole post is composed of <em>pieces of content</em>â€”somewhat similar to LEGO bricksâ€”that you can move around and interact with. Move your <a href="#">cursor around</a> and youâ€™ll notice the different blocks light up with outlines and arrows. Press the arrows to reposition blocks quickly, without fearing about losing things in the process of copying and pasting.</p>



<p>What you are reading now is a <strong>text block</strong> the most basic block of all. The text block has its own controls to be moved freely around the post&#8230;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-dots"/>



<p>Headings are separate blocks as well, which helps with the outline and organization of your content.</p>



<h2>A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words</h2>



<p>Handling images and media with the utmost care is a primary focus of the new editor. Hopefully, youâ€™ll find aspects of adding captions or going full-width with your pictures much easier and robust than before.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cover has-black-background-color has-background-dim alignwide" style="background-image:url(https://cloudinteam.github.io/cloudin-corp-site/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/emaus_single_post_img_1-min.jpg)"><div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container">
<p style="text-align:center" class="has-text-color has-large-font-size has-white-color">Striving for Perfection</p>
</div></div>



<p>Try selecting and removing or editing the caption, now you donâ€™t have to be careful about selecting the image or other text by mistake and ruining the presentation.</p>



<h2>The <em>Inserter</em> Tool</h2>



<p>Imagine everything that WordPress can do is available to you quickly and in the same place on the interface. No need to figure out HTML tags, classes, or remember complicated shortcode syntax. Thatâ€™s the spirit behind the inserterâ€”the <code>(+)</code> button youâ€™ll see around the editorâ€”which allows you to browse all available content blocks and add them into your post. Plugins and themes are able to register their own, opening up all sort of possibilities for rich editing and publishing.</p>



<h4>Amazing Tables</h4>



<table class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><tbody><tr><td><strong>ID</strong></td><td><strong>Name</strong></td><td><strong>Last Name</strong></td><td><strong>Profession</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Kazumi</td><td>Mishima</td><td>Designer</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Sergei</td><td>Dragounov</td><td>Developer</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Jozie</td><td>Rizal</td><td>Support</td></tr></tbody></table>



<p>Go give it a try, you may discover things WordPress can already add into your posts that you didnâ€™t know about. Hereâ€™s a short list of what you can currently find there:</p>



<ul><li>Text &amp; Headings</li><li>Images &amp; Videos</li><li>Galleries</li><li>Embeds, like YouTube, Tweets, or other WordPress posts.</li><li>Layout blocks, like Buttons, Hero Images, Separators, etc.</li><li>And <em>Lists</em> like this one of course <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignleft is-style-default"><blockquote><p><em>Only a quarter of young adults are financially literate. You donâ€™t want to overwhelm them.</em></p><cite>William Longgood</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Imagine everything that WordPress can do is available to you quickly and in the same place on the interface. No need to figure out HTML tags, classes, or remember complicated shortcode syntax.</p>



<p>Thatâ€™s the spirit behind the inserterâ€”the&nbsp;<code>(+)</code>&nbsp;button youâ€™ll see around the editorâ€”which allows you to browse all available content blocks and add them into your post. Plugins and themes are able to register their own, opening up all sort of possibilities for rich editing and publishing. Imagine everything that WordPress can do is available to you quickly and in the same place on the interface. No need to figure out HTML tags </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-wide"/>



<h2>Visual Editing</h2>



<p>A huge benefit of blocks is that you can edit them in place and manipulate your content directly. Instead of having fields for editing things like the source of a quote, or the text of a button, you can directly change the content. Try editing the following quote:</p>



<blockquote style="text-align:left" class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p><em>Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.</em> </p><cite>Matt Mullenweg, 2017</cite></blockquote>



<p>The information corresponding to the source of the quote is a separate text field, similar to captions under images, so the structure of the quote is protected even if you select, modify, or remove the source. Itâ€™s always easy to add it back.</p>



<p>Blocks can be anything you need. For instance, you may want to add a subdued quote as part of the composition of your text, or you may prefer to display a giant stylized one. All of these options are available in the inserter.</p>



<ul class="is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-1 wp-block-gallery columns-3 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cloudinteam.github.io/cloudin-corp-site/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/emaus_single_post_gallery_1.jpg" alt="emaus_single_post_gallery_1" data-id="667" data-link="https://emaus.deothemes.com/the-easy-way-to-add-fonts-to-your-website-including-custom-fonts/emaus_single_post_gallery_1/" class="wp-image-667"/><figcaption>Marketing Plan</figcaption></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cloudinteam.github.io/cloudin-corp-site/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/emaus_single_post_gallery_2.jpg" alt="emaus_single_post_gallery_2" data-id="668" data-link="https://emaus.deothemes.com/the-easy-way-to-add-fonts-to-your-website-including-custom-fonts/emaus_single_post_gallery_2/" class="wp-image-668"/><figcaption>User Interface</figcaption></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cloudinteam.github.io/cloudin-corp-site/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/emaus_single_post_gallery_3.jpg" alt="emaus_single_post_gallery_3" data-id="669" data-link="https://emaus.deothemes.com/the-easy-way-to-add-fonts-to-your-website-including-custom-fonts/emaus_single_post_gallery_3/" class="wp-image-669"/><figcaption>Office Space</figcaption></figure></li></ul>



<p>You can change the amount of columns in your galleries by dragging a slider in the block inspector in the sidebar.</p>



<h2>Media Rich</h2>



<p>If you combine the new <strong>wide</strong> and <strong>full-wide</strong> alignments with galleries, you can create a very media rich layout, very quickly:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://emaus.deothemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/emaus_blog_single_post_fullwidth_image-min-1024x576.jpg" alt="emaus_blog_single_post_fullwidth_image-min" class="wp-image-188" srcset="https://cloudinteam.github.io/cloudin-corp-site/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/emaus_blog_single_post_fullwidth_image-min-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://cloudinteam.github.io/cloudin-corp-site/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/emaus_blog_single_post_fullwidth_image-min-300x169.jpg 300w, https://cloudinteam.github.io/cloudin-corp-site/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/emaus_blog_single_post_fullwidth_image-min-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cloudinteam.github.io/cloudin-corp-site/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/emaus_blog_single_post_fullwidth_image-min-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://cloudinteam.github.io/cloudin-corp-site/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/emaus_blog_single_post_fullwidth_image-min.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Sure, the full-wide image can be pretty big. But sometimes the image is worth it.</p>



<ul class="is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-3 wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cloudinteam.github.io/cloudin-corp-site/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/emaus_single_post_img_6-min.jpg" alt="emaus_single_post_img_6-min" data-id="193" data-link="https://emaus.deothemes.com/business-mistakes-to-avoid-when-starting-a-business/emaus_single_post_img_6-min/" class="wp-image-193"/></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img decoding="async" src="https://cloudinteam.github.io/cloudin-corp-site/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/emaus_single_post_img_5-min.jpg" alt="emaus_single_post_img_5-min" data-id="194" data-link="https://emaus.deothemes.com/business-mistakes-to-avoid-when-starting-a-business/emaus_single_post_img_5-min/" class="wp-image-194"/></figure></li></ul>



<p>The above is a gallery with just two images. Itâ€™s an easier way to create visually appealing layouts, without having to deal with floats. You can also easily convert the gallery back to individual images again, by using the block switcher.</p>



<p>Any block can opt into these alignments. The embed block has them also, and is responsive out of the box:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-has-aspect-ratio wp-embed-aspect-16-9"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="Startup Weekend - Full" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/32424882?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="1170" height="658" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p style="text-align:center"><em> If you want to learn more about how to build additional blocks, or if you are interested in helping with the project, head over to the <a href="#">GitHub repository</a>. </em></p>



<div class="wp-block-button aligncenter"><a class="wp-block-button__link" href="https://deothemes.com/">Purchase Now</a></div>
