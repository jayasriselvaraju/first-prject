Press the arrows to reposition blocks quickly, without fearing about losing things in the process of copying and pasting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you are reading now is a <strong>text block<\/strong> the most basic block of all.

Instead of having fields for editing things like the source of a quote, or the text of a button, you can directly change the content. Try editing the following quote:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote style=\"text-align:left\" class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\"><p><em>Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.<\/em> <\/p><cite>Matt Mullenweg, 2017<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The information corresponding to the source of the quote is a separate text field, similar to captions under images, so the structure of the quote is protected even if you select, modify, or remove the source. It\u2019s always easy to add it back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blocks can be anything you need. For instance, you may want to add a subdued quote as part of the composition of your text, or you may prefer to display a giant stylized one. All of these options are available in the inserter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-1 wp-block-gallery columns-3 is-cropped\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/cloudin-corp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/emaus_single_post_gallery_1.jpg\" alt=\"emaus_single_post_gallery_1\" data-id=\"667\" data-link=\"https:\/\/emaus.deothemes.com\/the-easy-way-to-add-fonts-to-your-website-including-custom-fonts\/emaus_single_post_gallery_1\/\" class=\"wp-image-667\"\/><figcaption>Marketing Plan<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/cloudin-corp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/emaus_single_post_gallery_2.jpg\" alt=\"emaus_single_post_gallery_2\" data-id=\"668\" data-link=\"https:\/\/emaus.deothemes.com\/the-easy-way-to-add-fonts-to-your-website-including-custom-fonts\/emaus_single_post_gallery_2\/\" class=\"wp-image-668\"\/><figcaption>User Interface<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/cloudin-corp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/emaus_single_post_gallery_3.jpg\" alt=\"emaus_single_post_gallery_3\" data-id=\"669\" data-link=\"https:\/\/emaus.deothemes.com\/the-easy-way-to-add-fonts-to-your-website-including-custom-fonts\/emaus_single_post_gallery_3\/\" class=\"wp-image-669\"\/><figcaption>Office Space<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can change the amount of columns in your galleries by dragging a slider in the block inspector in the sidebar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Media Rich<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you combine the new <strong>wide<\/strong> and <strong>full-wide<\/strong> alignments with galleries, you can create a very media rich layout, very quickly:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https:\/\/emaus.deothemes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/emaus_blog_single_post_fullwidth_image-min-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"emaus_blog_single_post_fullwidth_image-min\" class=\"wp-image-188\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/cloudin-corp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/emaus_blog_single_post_fullwidth_image-min-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/localhost\/cloudin-corp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/emaus_blog_single_post_fullwidth_image-min-300x169.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/cloudin-corp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/emaus_blog_single_post_fullwidth_image-min-768x432.jpg 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/cloudin-corp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/emaus_blog_single_post_fullwidth_image-min-1536x864.jpg 1536w, http:\/\/localhost\/cloudin-corp\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/emaus_blog_single_post_fullwidth_image-min.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, the full-wide image can be pretty big.
